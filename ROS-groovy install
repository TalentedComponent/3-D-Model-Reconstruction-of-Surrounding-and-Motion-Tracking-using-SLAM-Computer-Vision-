NOTE: I used Ubuntu 12.04 - 32 bit. I have also installed ROS Groovy which was the 6th ROS distribution release.

Instructions for Installing ROS GROOVY:
Original Link: http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/Ubuntu

1) Configure your Ubuntu repositories to allow "restricted," "universe," and "multiverse."

See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu to do this.

2) Setup your computer to accept software from packages.ros.org. For Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise). To do this, in the terminal, type:

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

3) Set up your keys

wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add –

4) Check your Debian package is up to date

sudo apt-get update

5) For the full installation [(recommended as it provides Rviz (visualization tool of ROS) and other desired features]

sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-desktop-full

6) Initialize rosdep – before you can use ROS, you will need to initialize rosdep. 

sudo rosdep init

rosdep update

7) You would want your environment variables to be automatically added to your bash session every time a new shell is launched. 

echo "source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

source ~/.bashrc


8) Ensure you download rosinstall – it will allow you to download ROS packages with one command.

sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall
