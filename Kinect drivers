Instructions for Installing Kinect drivers: 

1.) After successful installation of ROS groovy do the following steps:
 
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-openni-*

To check if the drivers were Installed properly:

Option A: Inside ROS I.e using ROS

Connect the Kinect to the USB port and launch the following commands in  the terminal

roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

rosrun rviz rviz

Once Rviz is running (the visualization tool of ROS)

–	The default Rviz file will start automatically and you'll be able to see the Point clouds.

Note:
The default configuration file(its has .rviz extension)  is already stored in the Sony Vaio i7 laptopp given to me.

–	If in case the file doesn't startup, do the following things:

Under Global Option, Fixed Frame should be at /camera_rgb_frame topic
Select the Add button and add the PointCloud2 option. This PointCloud2 option should have /camera/depth_registered/points as its topic. Also change the Color Transformation to RGB8 to see the colored point clouds.

Option B: Outside ROS I.e not using ROS

sudo apt-get install freenect

freenect-glview
